The objective of Fair Play is to foster a sporting spirit, as well as the sporting behaviour of coaches, players, team officials and spectators, thereby increasing the enjoyment of all those involved in the game.</p><br><br><p>In order that clubs may address the behaviour of supporters in a meaningful way, consideration must be given to the actions and activities of four integral parts of those associated with the club; its coaches, players, officials and the parents and guardians of its youth players.</p><br><br><h3>1.    Code of Conduct for Coaches</h3><br><br><p>Coaches are key to the establishment of ethics in football.  Their concept of ethics and their attitude directly affects the behaviour of players under their supervision.  Coaches are, therefore expected to pay particular care to the moral aspect of their conduct.</p><br><br><p>Coaches have to be aware that almost all of their everyday decisions and choices of actions, as well as strategic targets, have ethical implications.</p><br><br><p>It is natural that winning constitutes a basic concern for coaches.  This code is not intended to conflict with that.  However, the code calls for coaches to disassociate themselves from a “win-at-all-costs” attitude.</p><br><br><p>Increased responsibility is requested from coaches involved in coaching young people.  The health, safety, welfare and moral education of young people are a first priority, before the achievement or the reputation of the club, school, coach or parent.</p><br><br><h3>1.1</h3>    <p>Coaches must respect the rights, dignity and worth of each and every person and treat each equally within the context of the sport.</p><br><br><h3>1.2</h3>    <p>Coaches must place the well-being and safety of each player above all other considerations, including the development of performance.</p><br><br><h3>1.3</h3>    <p>Coaches must adhere to all guidelines laid down by governing bodies.</p><br><br><h3>1.4 </h3>   <p>Coaches must develop an appropriate working relationship with each player based on mutual trust and respect.</p><br><br><h3>1.5 </h3>   <p>Coaches must not exert undue influence to obtain personal benefit or reward.</p><br><br><h3>1.6</h3>    <p>Coaches must encourage and guide players to accept responsibility for their own behaviour and performance.</p><br><br><h3>1.7</h3>    <p>Coaches must ensure that the activities they direct or advocate are appropriate for the age, maturity, experience and ability of players.</p><br><br><h3>1.8</h3>    <p>Coaches should, at the outset, clarify with the players (and, where appropriate, parent) exactly what is expected of them and also what they are entitled to expect from their coach.</p><br><br><h3>1.9</h3>    <p>Coaches must co-operate fully with other specialists (e.g. other coaches, officials, sports scientists, doctors, physiotherapists) in the best interests of the player.</p><br><br><h3>1.10</h3>    <p>Coaches must always promote the positive aspects of the sport (e.g. fair play) and never condone violations of the Laws of the Game, behaviour contrary to the spirit of the Laws of the Game or relevant rules and regulations or the use of prohibited substances or techniques.</p><br><br><h3>1.11</h3>    <p>Coaches must consistently display high standards of behaviour and appearance.</p><br><br><h3>1.12</h3>    <p>Coaches must not use or tolerate inappropriate language.</p><br><br><h3>1.13</h3>    <p>Coaches must promote and encourage, particularly to young players, the importance of a healthy lifestyle and diet.</p><br><br><h3>1.14</h3>    <p>Coaches must provide guidance and support to players on the dangers of drug abuse.</p><br><br><h3>1.15</h3> 	<p>Coaches must adhere to the terms of the Club’s Policy on Anti-Discrimination.</p><br><br><h3>2.    Code of Conduct for Players</h3><br><br><p>Players are the most important people in the sport.  Playing for the team, and for the team to win, is the most fundamental part of the game.  But not winning at any cost – Fair Play and respect for all others in the game is fundamentally important.</p><br><br><p>This Code focuses on players involved in top-class football.  Nevertheless, the key concepts in the Code are valid for players at all levels.</p><br><br><h3>2.1     Obligations towards the game</h3><br><br><p>A player should:</p><br><h3>2.1.1</h3>      <p>Make every effort to develop their own sporting abilities, in terms of skill, technique, tactics and stamina.</p><br><h3>2.1.2</h3>    <p>Make every effort to lead a healthy lifestyle which will include an appropriate diet and an avoidance of recreational or performance enhancing drugs.</p><br><h3>2.1.3</h3>    <p>Give maximum effort and strive for the best possible performance during a game, even if his team is in a position where the desired result has already been achieved.</p><br><h3>2.1.4</h3>   <p>Set a positive example for others, particularly young players and supporters.</p><br><h3>2.1.5</h3>    <p>Avoid all forms of gamesmanship and time-wasting.</p><br><h3>2.1.6</h3>    <p>Always have regard for the best interests of the game, including where publicly expressing an opinion on the game and any particular aspect of it, including others involved in the game.</p><br><h3>2.1.7</h3>    <p>Not use inappropriate language.</p><br><br><h3>2.2    Obligations towards one’s own team</h3><br><br><p>A player should:</p><br><h3>2.2.1</h3>    <p>Make every effort consistent with Fair Play and the Laws of the Game to help his own team win.</p><br><h3>2.2.2</h3>    <p>Resist any influence that might, or might be seen to, bring into question his commitment to the team winning.</p><br><h3>2.3</h3>     <p>Respect for the Laws of the Game and competition rules</p><br><h3>2.3.1</h3>    <p>Know and abide by the Laws, rules and spirit of the game, and the competition rules.</p><br><h3>2.3.2</h3>    <p>Accept success and failure, victory and defeat with an equal measure of dignity.</p><br><h3>2.3.3</h3>    <p>Resist any temptation to take banned substances or use banned techniques.</p><br><h3>2.4</h3>     <p>Show respect towards Opponents</p><br><h3>2.4.1</h3>    <p>Treat opponents with due respect at all times, irrespective of the result of the game.</p><br><h3>2.4.2</h3>    <p>Safeguard the physical fitness of opponents, avoid violence and rough play, and help injured opponents.</p><br><br><br><h3>2.5</h3><br><br><p>A player should:<br><h3>2.5.1</h3>    Accept the decision of the Match Official without protest.<br><h3>2.5.2</h3>    Avoid words or actions that may mislead a Match Official.<br><h3>2.5.3</h3>   Show due respect towards Match Officials.</p><br><br><br><h3>2.6      Respect towards Team Officials</h3><br><br><p>A player should:</p><br><h3>2.6.1</h3>    <p>Abide by the instructions of their Coach and Team Officials, provided they do not contradict the spirit of this Code.</p><br><h3>2.6.2</h3>    <p>Show due respect towards the Team Officials of the opposition.</p><br><br><br><h3>2.7     Obligations towards the Supporters</h3><br><br><p>A player should:</p><br><h3>2.7.1 </h3>   <p>Show due respect to the interests of supporters.</p><br><br><br><h3>General Obligations</h3><br><br><p>A player should:</p><br><h3>2.8.1</h3>    <p>Adhere to the terms of the Club’s Policy on Anti-Discrimination.</p><br><br><br><h3>3.

Code of Conduct for Parents and Guardians with young players connected with the club</h3><br><br><p>Parents have a great influence on children’s enjoyment and success in football.  All children play football because they first and foremost love the game – it’s fun.  It is important to remember that however good a child becomes at football within your club it is important to reinforce the message to parents that positive encouragement will contribute to:</p><br>				<ul class="list">					<li>Children enjoying football.</li>					<li>A sense of personal achievement.</li>					<li>Self-esteem.</li>					<li>Improving the child’s skills and techniques.</li>				</ul>				<br><br><p>A parent’s expectations and attitudes have a significant bearing on a child’s attitude towards:</p><br>				<ul class="list">					<li>Other players.</li>					<li>Officials.</li>					<li>Managers.</li>					<li>Spectators.</li>					<li>Ensure that parents within your club are always positive and encouraging <br>towards all of the children not just their own.</li>				</ul>				<br><br><p>Encourage parents to:</p><br>				<ul class="list">					<li>Applaud the opposition as well as your own team.</li>					<li>Avoid coaching the child during the game.</li>					<li>Not to shout and scream.</li>					<li>Respect the referee’s decision.</li>					<li>Give attention to each of the children involved <br>in football not just the most talented.</li>					<li>Give encouragement to everyone to participate in football.</li>					<li>Adhere to the terms of the Club’s Policy on Anti-Discrimination.</li>					<li>Ensure that parents within your club agree and <br>adhere to your club’s Code of Conduct and Child Protection Policy.</li>				</ul><br><br><h3>5 Codes of Conduct for Supporters</h3><br><br><p>Once a club has addressed the conduct of its coaches, players, officials and parents and guardians of its young players it will be in a position to set an appropriate example to its supporters in terms of their behaviour.</p><br><br><p>The crowd is considered to be an organic component of a football game.<br>The support of the fans may contribute to the success of the team.<br>The crowd is not expected to watch the game in silence.<br>Encouragement of the teams by shouting, non-abusive singing, etc. may have a positive influence on the atmosphere in accordance with the spirit of Fair Play.<br><br>The spectators are, however, expected to respect the opponents and the referee.
