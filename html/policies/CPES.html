Such a decision would be made by the match officials, in discussions with club officials or the police if appropriate.<br>							Spectators awaiting entry will be kept informed of what is happening at all times via the PA system or directly by club officials / stewards</p>										<p>LATE POSTPONEMENT OR MATCH ABANDONED<br>								If a decision to postpone a match is taken just before kick off time when spectators are queuing to get into the ground or if a match is abandoned, the spectators will be kept fully informed via the PA system or directly by club officials. This information will include details of any refunds or issue of vouchers, in strict accordance with the S.F.A. document “Ground Regulations” </p>					<p>CROWD CONTROL<br>								If a situation arises involving unruly crowd behaviour which may lead to surging, crushing or pitch invasion, the stewards, assisted by club officials will attempt to resolve the situation. If it is clear that this is impossible, the police will be notified immediately by the safety advisor or another senior club official.</p>					<p>POWER CUTS<br>								If a power cut occurs during a floodlit match and the referee decides to abandon the game, spectators will be kept informed by stewards and club officials. If the normal PA system is inoperable, a back-up system will be used.<br>								Stewards will ensure that spectators leave the ground safely, with disabled spectators getting assistance as required.</p>					<p>FIRE<br>								It has been identified that the main fire risk, with safety implications for spectators, is the wooden Shop and grounds mans store. Various measure to mitigate this risk have been put in place but in the event of a fire in this area, the following steps will be taken: As soon as a steward or club official learns of fire in this area, spectators will be informed immediately by an appropriate method, to leave the shop at the nearest exit: Stewards will ensure that all spectators exit the area safely: Depending on the extent and ferocity of the fire, stewards and or club officials will attempt to fight the fire with the fire extinguishers which are located at the store, without placing themselves or others in danger. If it is clear that this is impossible the fire service will be called immediately. Responsibility for contacting the fire service rests with the safety advisor or senior club official.</p>										<p>EMERGENCY EVACUATION<br>If an emergency evacuation of the ground is required, stewards will ensure that spectators get out of the ground safely at the nearest exit. In such evacuations stewards will ensure all disabled spectators make a safe exit from the ground, offering whatever assistance is required; Exits will be identified to avoid confusion when announcements are made. If only specific exit(s) can be used for evacuation, the announcement will make reference to the appropriate gate.</p>										<p>IF A DECISION IS MADE TO EVACUATE THE GROUND, THE ANNOUNCEMENT WILL BE AS FOLLOWS : AN EMERGENCY SITUATION HAS ARISEN IN THE GROUND, PLEASE LEAVE THE GROUND IMMEDIATELY, IN AN ORDERLY MANNER BY THE NEAREST AVAILABLE EXIT.</p>										<p>PLAYERS AND MATCH OFFICIALS<br>Players and officials will be instructed to congregate in the centre circle until the situation can be assessed to see if it is safe to return to the dressing rooms. If not, they will leave the ground at an appropriate exit.</p>									</div>				<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->				</section>			<div id="footer">								<div id="sponsors">					<a href="http://www.grampianfurnishers.com/"><img src="../../images/grampianFurnishers.png" alt="Grampian Furnishers logo"></a>					<a href="http://www.mcdonaldandmunro.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/McDonald%20&%20Munro%20Ltd.png" alt="McDonald and Munro Ltd Logo"></a>					<a href="https://www.stewartlyon.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/Stewart%20Lyon%20Financial%20Services.png" alt="SLFS logo"></a>					<a href="https://fibre1.uk/"><img src="../../images/Fibre%201.png" alt="Fibre 1 Logo"></a>					<a href="https://firth.hotellossiemouthscotland.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/Firth%20Hotel.png" alt="Firth Hotel logo"></a>					<a href="https://www.kineilcoachesltd.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/Tracksuits%20Sponsor.png" alt="Kineil Coaches Ltd Logo"></a>				</div>								<div id="footNav">					<button class="accordion">Navigation</button>					<div class="panel">						 <ul>							<li><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li>							<li><a href="../events.html">Events</a></li>							<li><a href="../club.html">Club</a></li>							<li><a href="../contact.html">Contact us</a></li>						</ul>					</div>					<div class="footerSep"></div>					<button class="accordion">Our Policies</button>					<div class="panel">						 <ul>							<li><a href="ADP.html">Anti-Discrimination Policy</a></li>							<li><a href="CC.html">Club Charter</a></li>							<li><a href="CoC.html">Codes of Conduct</a></li>							<li><a href="CPES.html">Contingency Plan for Emergency Situations</a></li>							<li><a href="CC2.html">Customer Charter</a></li>							<li><a href="LFCWPP.html">Lossiemouth FC Child Wellbeing and Protection Policies</a></li>							<li><a href="DDP.html">Disability Discrimination Policies</a></li>							<li><a href="EHP.html">Environmental Health Policies</a></li>							<li><a href="SP.html">Safety Policy</a></li>							<li><a href="UC.html">Unacceptable Conduct</a></li>						</ul>					</div>					<div class="footerSep"></div>				</div>								<div class="footSocial">					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LossiemouthFC"></a>					<a href="https://twitter.com/lossiemouthfc"></a>				</div>								<footer> Copyright &copy; 2020 Lossiemouth FC.
