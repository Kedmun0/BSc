Disability Discrimination Act</h1>								<div class="block">										<h1 class="subheading">Club Policy</h1>										<h2>Introduction</h2>										<p>This policy is applicable to all staff, contract workers, spectators and guests of the Club on all premises and places of work occupied by the Club.</p>										<p>In line with the 2010 Equality Act, in this policy:</p>										<ul class="list">						<li>DISABILITY refers to a physical or mental impairment which has a substantial and long-term adverse effect on his ability to carry out normal day-to-day activities.</li>						<li>DISABLED PERSON refers to a person with such a disability.</li>						<li>DISCRIMINATION refers to treating someone with a disability less favourably than he treats others whom have no disability, and that treatment cannot be shown to be justified in relation to the activities or circumstances involved.</li>					</ul>										<h1 class="subheading">Staff and Contract Workers</h1>										<h2>Employment</h2>										<p>Lossiemouth FC will not discriminate against a disabled person:</p>										<ul class="list">						<li>In the arrangements made for the purpose of determining whom employment should be offered to.</li>						<li>In the terms under which employment is offered.</li>						<li>In deliberately refusing to offer or not offering employment to someone based on their disability.</li>						<li>In the opportunities afforded to a person (i.e. training, promotions or any other work benefit).</li>						<li>In dismissing someone or subjecting them to any detriment based on their disability.</li>					</ul>										<p>In the successful recruitment of a person with a disability, Lossiemouth Football Club will make the necessary adjustments to their work environment so as to suit that person and allow them to undertake their work to the standard agreed upon employment.</p>										<p>This may include:</p>										<ul class="list">						<li>Adjustment of the premises</li>						<li>Allocation of duties to another person</li>						<li>Alteration of work hours</li>						<li>Arrangements for training</li>						<li>Provision of safe and suitable equipment, instructions and supervisors where required.</li>					</ul>										<p>These steps will be undertaken, within reason and practicality, allowing for financial costs and disruption of business activities.</p>										<p>Lossiemouth FC will operate a grievance policy for the reporting of discrimination based upon disability as follows:</p>										<ol class="list">						<li>In the event of witnessing or experiencing discrimination due to a disability, direct contact should be made with the employee’s line manager or the personnel manager (Club Secretary).</li>						<li>The club secretary should make an initial report based on the verbal account and should arrange for an interview at a later date, asking the employee to formalise the complaint by providing a written account. Should the employee be unable or unwilling to make a written account, statement will be written for them based on their account in the interview, which they should sign to verify.</li>						<li>The employee should be offered a union representative or suitable member of staff to accompany them in the interview, should they see fit. Also present in the interview should be two members of staff from the personnel manager, the Club’s safety officer, a director or the employee’s line manager.</li>						<li>The incident will then be investigated thoroughly, taking into account other eyewitness statements and a formal interview with the person accused of discriminatory behaviour. This interview should be conducted under the same conditions as the person discriminated against.</li>						<li>The findings of both interviews will then be presented to the Board of Directors and Chairman who will take the necessary action as specified in the Club’s employment policy and disciplinary procedure. The Club will not tolerate any act of discrimination and this will be recorded as Gross Misconduct, in accordance with the disciplinary procedure.</li>					</ol>										<p>All staff will be notified of the procedure in their employment pack. All contract workers, guests and supporters will be notified by the public display of the policy (online, in club communications and on display in public areas of Grant Park).</p>										<h1 class="subheading">Premises</h1>										<p>As stated, Lossiemouth FC will make reasonable adjustments to work premises to suit the requirements of all disabled employees.</p>										<p>The Club recognises that not all of its facilities are fully accessible to disabled guests, contract workers and spectators and confirms that it is committed to making the necessary reasonable adjustments described by the Equality Act 2010 and its relevant Codes of Practice to ensure full compliance with the legislation.</p>										<p>The Club also recognises that new duties or legislation may be introduced from time to time that will be intended to remove permanent barriers that make it difficult or impossible for some disabled customers to access Club facilities.</p>										<p>The Club will undertake such additional works as are reasonably required within the timescales set out by the various agencies and will ensure that all relevant staff is trained in the necessary regulations or guidelines.</p>										<h1 class="subheading">Emergency plan</h1>										<p>As outlined in the Club’s contingency plan, agreed upon by Police Scotland, both home and away DISABLED supporters will be situated in the area outside the Dressing room complex and to the left of the refreshment shop.</p>										<p>In the event of an emergency, disabled supporters will be assisted to the nearest exit gates by the committee / stewards specifically placed there for that purpose.</p>										<p>It is expected that all disabled spectators with a disability that may prevent their safe egress will make themselves known to the Club Secretary or to a steward before the match. They will then be seated in the areas as to allow their safe exit.</p>										<p>Any disabled members of staff will be working in an environment adjusted by the club to allow their swift and safe egress in the event of an emergency. The Club will regularly operate an emergency drill procedure to safeguard against complacency and to maintain awareness.</p>										<h1 class="subheading">Disabled Supporters</h1>										<p>Lossiemouth Football Club is committed to ensuring that its disabled supporters and customers have as full access as is reasonably possible to make, to all goods, services and facilities provided or offered to the public by the Club.</p>										<p>The Club will operate a concessionary ticketing policy for disabled supporters and will ensure that the scheme does not discriminate between disabled people with differing impairments.</p>										<p>The Club recognises that not all of its facilities are fully accessible to disabled customers and confirms that it is committed to making the necessary reasonable adjustments described by the Equality Act 2010 and its relevant Codes of Practice to ensure full compliance with the legislation.</p>										<p>The Club also recognises that new duties or legislation may be introduced from time to time that will be intended to remove permanent barriers that make it difficult or impossible for some disabled customers to access Club facilities.</p>										<p>The Club will undertake such additional works as are reasonably required within the timescales set out by the various agencies and will ensure that all relevant staff is trained in the necessary regulations or guidelines.</p>										<p>The Club has a grievance procedure in place and guarantees to its disabled supporters and customers that any complaints of discrimination will be dealt with quickly under that procedure.</p>										<ol class="list">						<li>In the event of witnessing or experiencing discrimination due to a disability, direct contact should be made with the personnel manager (Club Secretary).</li>						<li>The club secretary should make an initial report based on the verbal account and should arrange for an interview at a later date, asking the person to formalise the complaint by providing a written account. Should the person be unable or unwilling to make a written account, statement will be written for them based on their account in the interview, which they should sign to verify. Should the person be unable to attend an interview, all efforts will be made to secure a formal statement. If no such statement is available, the initial complaint should be taken as the formal complaint.</li>						<li>The person should be offered a care worker or suitable family member to accompany them in the interview, should they see fit. Also present in the interview should be two members of staff from the personnel manager, the Club’s safety officer, a director or the employee’s line manager.</li>						<li>The incident will then be reported to the police and the person accused of discriminatory behaviour identified. If the person is a member of staff, it should be investigated thoroughly taking into account other eyewitness statements and a formal interview with the person accused of discriminatory behaviour. This interview should be conducted under the same conditions as the person discriminated against. If another spectator is accused of the discrimination, the police should deal with the complaint and the Club will react to their decision.</li>						<li>The findings of both interviews will then be presented to the Board of Directors and Chairman who will take the necessary action as specified in the Club’s employment policy and disciplinary procedure or as specified in the Club’s spectator policy.</li>						<li>The Club will not tolerate any act of discrimination and this will be recorded as Gross Misconduct, in accordance with the disciplinary procedure.</li>					</ol>										<p>Additionally, the Club will not tolerate abuse of disabled Supporters or customers by other visitors to the stadium. Should an incident of this nature be brought to the attention of the Club it will eject from the stadium or withdraw access to the stadium to the abusive parties?</p>										<p>All staff will be notified of the procedure in their employment pack.</p>										<p>A hard copy of this policy will be available for review from the Club Secretary; additionally the information will be displayed in the public domain online <a  href="www.lossiemouthfc.co.uk" style="color: #C12027;">here</a></p>										<p>Created November 2009<br><br>					Passed by Committee December 2009<br><br>					Reviewed June 2019 secretary<br><br>					Reviewed July 2020</p>										<br><br>										<a href="http://www.lossiemouthfc.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/Disabled-policy-and-discrimination-policy2017.pdf" id="quicklink">Download a PDF copy here</a>								</div>				<!-- InstanceEndEditable -->				</section>			<div id="footer">								<div id="sponsors">					<a href="http://www.grampianfurnishers.com/"><img src="../../images/grampianFurnishers.png" alt="Grampian Furnishers logo"></a>					<a href="http://www.mcdonaldandmunro.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/McDonald%20&%20Munro%20Ltd.png" alt="McDonald and Munro Ltd Logo"></a>					<a href="https://www.stewartlyon.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/Stewart%20Lyon%20Financial%20Services.png" alt="SLFS logo"></a>					<a href="https://fibre1.uk/"><img src="../../images/Fibre%201.png" alt="Fibre 1 Logo"></a>					<a href="https://firth.hotellossiemouthscotland.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/Firth%20Hotel.png" alt="Firth Hotel logo"></a>					<a href="https://www.kineilcoachesltd.co.uk/"><img src="../../images/Tracksuits%20Sponsor.png" alt="Kineil Coaches Ltd Logo"></a>				</div>								<div id="footNav">					<button class="accordion">Navigation</button>					<div class="panel">						 <ul>							<li><a href="../../index.html">Home</a></li>							<li><a href="../events.html">Events</a></li>							<li><a href="../club.html">Club</a></li>							<li><a href="../contact.html">Contact us</a></li>						</ul>					</div>					<div class="footerSep"></div>					<button class="accordion">Our Policies</button>					<div class="panel">						 <ul>							<li><a href="ADP.html">Anti-Discrimination Policy</a></li>							<li><a href="CC.html">Club Charter</a></li>							<li><a href="CoC.html">Codes of Conduct</a></li>							<li><a href="CPES.html">Contingency Plan for Emergency Situations</a></li>							<li><a href="CC2.html">Customer Charter</a></li>							<li><a href="LFCWPP.html">Lossiemouth FC Child Wellbeing and Protection Policies</a></li>							<li><a href="DDP.html">Disability Discrimination Policies</a></li>							<li><a href="EHP.html">Environmental Health Policies</a></li>							<li><a href="SP.html">Safety Policy</a></li>							<li><a href="UC.html">Unacceptable Conduct</a></li>						</ul>					</div>					<div class="footerSep"></div>				</div>								<div class="footSocial">					<a href="https://www.facebook.com/LossiemouthFC"></a>					<a href="https://twitter.com/lossiemouthfc"></a>				</div>								<footer> Copyright &copy; 2020 Lossiemouth FC.
